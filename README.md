# Data Analyst Journey

Hi, I’m Aditi 👋  
This repository documents my journey of learning Data Analysis as a Class 12 Humanities student.

I created this repo to:
- practice what I learn
- track my progress step by step
- build a strong foundation in data analysis tools

This is a **learning repository**, not a showcase of expert-level work.
